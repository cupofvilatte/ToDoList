# Overview

This java project is a TO-DO List program which allows the user to create tasks to complete, keep track of them, and check them off. The program is versatile to include tasks that need repeated on a regular basis, tasks that only have to be completed once, and tasks that need to be completed a quantivative amount, such as three times, without forcing the user to add the task 3 times.

I decided to build this project in Java because it is a common language in the coding industry with a diverse range of uses. Some of the things Java can be used to do is develop andriod mobile apps, web apps, and games. Java is even often used to develop software in physics. By involving myself in the Java scene, I am opening myself up to opportunities for both industrial involvement and personal growth. As I've done research and building for this project I have become increasingly fascinated with Java.

{Provide a description of the software that you wrote to demonstrate the Java language.}

The software for this project includes several classes such as the main App class, a Menu class, a List class, and classes for the List items. The Menu class is used to display a list of options to the console. The things the user can do is contained within the List class and List items classes.

The List items classes are connected using inheritance. This is to provide versatility for the 3 current main types of items, which are those that should be repeated in a certain time period, those which are only completed once, and those which are completed a certain amount of times.

The goal of this project was to give myself an introduction to Java and build something that can be useful. This project is useful for all people with busy lives. Many people have reported success by creating a checklist and marking off the items as they get done, so the goal of this project is to replicate that in a digital environment.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration. It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code. Focus should be on sharing what you learned about the language syntax.}
